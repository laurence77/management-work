## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### New Admin Endpoints Added
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/celebrities` - Create celebrities without auth
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/users` - Create users with full data
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/settings` - Fetch current settings
- ✅ `PUT /api/admin/settings` - Update system settings
